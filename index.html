      <h2> I'm Nils Mickos </h2>

        <p> What's up ! I am a french-finnish guy who speaks french, swedish and english, and my favorite things in the world are working out, eating food, and videogames. It may sound unhealthy at first glance but if you manage to balance all of your hobbies, you can live your best life. All of those things make me happy but aren't comparable to the people I love the most because they are just hobbies that can be replaced. </p>

      <h3> Rice milk </h3>
      <p> I love rice milk because it brings me back to when I was little and played outside with my friends. I used to rush into my house all excited with the urge to go back outside as fast as possible after chugging a glass of cold rice milk. </p>

        <h3> Overwatch </h3>
        <p> This is one of the games I have played the most, and I have become quite good at it. When I start playing a game or learning a sport, it is usually quite easy for me to become above average, however practicing to become even better at it is my weak spot. Nevertheless it is not the case with this game for some odd reason. I am happy to have found something that motivates me and helps me surpass my lazyness. Actually, this helps me undirectly with some other problems I have, other than with videogames or sports. </p>

        <h3> My loved ones </h3>
          <p> My family, my closest friends and my girlfriend mean the world to me and I couldn't be passionate about my hobbies if I didn't have them. I am what I am today thanks to these people and I am so very grateful for it. </p>
